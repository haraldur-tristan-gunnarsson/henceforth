does C have a "typeof" operator, like "sizeof"?


rlwrap

fix deletion_mark on x86_64 -- difficult to reproduce error.
align dictionary entries on size_t/CELL to make dumps more useful (NEXT would be made very clear)? would need to align after placing name as well (in semicolon).
iif{
SKIPBL? Would require some rearrangement of core.hfs (c, earlier etc.) and slight changes to ( and iifd{.
(.) and .
did iif{ based on [, how about EXEC based on [?
mechanism for creating references (place on return stack with >r then use PROCPTR) --> INNER callable within language, directly.
add TRACE example to hello.hfs.
"henceforth" stack-reordering word.
Add "TO" word that modifies existing dictionary entries to point to new code.

review CALL and INNER_INTERPRETER to see if there is a better way

place macro definition into string, how?

This code is POSIX-dependent and possibly Linux-dependent. If your kernel's virtual memory manager is not "lazy" in a similar manner to Linux's (which would probably be stupid, but what do I know?) then this program will claim a lot of your physical memory (about 1 part in 16, which is the amount of virtual memory claimed, usually); otherwise, just a few MiBs.

No floating point support, as yet.
