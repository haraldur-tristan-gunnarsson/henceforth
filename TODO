does C have a "typeof" operator, like "sizeof"? -- EDIT: It exists as a GNU extension.

Write shell script that applies rlwrap to inner.elf, if it is available, and which optionally runs the hello.hfs test script and/or the test.hfs test script.

fix deletion_mark -- difficult to reproduce error (or is it gone?).
align dictionary entries on size_t/CELL to make dumps more useful (NEXT would be made very clear)? would need to align after placing name as well (in semicolon).
add TRACE example to hello.hfs.
ifnd{ and ifn{ ( equivalent to ~ NOT ifd{ etc.) comes up a lot, so would be helpful if they existed (plus a little more efficient as JMPNZ rather than NOT NOT JMPNZ).
}ifr, to stand for '~ RET }if'
SKIPBL? Would require some rearrangement of core.hfs (c, earlier etc.) and slight changes to ( and iifd{.
Add "TO" word that modifies existing dictionary entries to point to new code.
mechanism for creating references (place on return stack with >r then use PROCPTR) --> INNER callable within language, directly.
"henceforth" stack-reordering word.
did iif{ based on [, how about EXEC based on [?

review CALL and INNER_INTERPRETER to see if there is a better way

place macro definition into string, how?

if the temp_entry dictionary was removed (so also hampering unstructured coding), then recursion would be much easier to do. This would work:
: RECURSE       ( --)                  [ HEAD @ , ] ;
