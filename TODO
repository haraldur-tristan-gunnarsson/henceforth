does C have a "typeof" operator, like "sizeof"? -- EDIT: It exists as a GNU extension.

Write shell script that applies rlwrap to inner.elf, if it is available.

add TRACE example to hello.hfs.
ifnd{ and ifn{ ( equivalent to ~ NOT ifd{ etc.) comes up a lot, so would be helpful if they existed (plus a little more efficient as JMPNZ rather than NOT NOT JMPNZ).
}ifr, to stand for '~ RET }if'
SKIPBL? Would require some rearrangement of core.hfs (c, earlier etc.) and slight changes to ( and iifd{.
Add "TO" word that modifies existing dictionary entries to point to new code.
mechanism for creating references (place on return stack with >r then use PROCPTR) --> INNER callable within language, directly.
"henceforth" stack-reordering word.
did iif{ based on [, how about EXEC based on [?

review CALL and INNER_INTERPRETER to see if there is a better way

place macro definition into string, how?
